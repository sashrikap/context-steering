The law states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the force applied to it and inversely proportional to its mass.\\nIn other words, the more massive an object is, the less it will accelerate when a force is applied to it. Similarly, the greater the force applied to an object, the more it will accelerate.\\nThe equation F = ma can be read as \"force equals mass times acceleration.\" This means that if you know the force acting on an object and its mass, you can use this equation to calculate its acceleration.\\nFor example, let\\'s say you have a 1-kilogram (kg) ball that you throw with a force of 10 newtons (N). Using Newton\\'s second law, you can calculate the acceleration of the ball as follows:\\nF = ma\\nF = 10 N\\nm = 1 kg\\na = F / m\\na = 10 N / 1 kg\\na = 10 m'}\n",

According to Newton's second law, the force acting on the car is:\\nF = ma = 1000 kg x 2 m/s^2 = 2000 N\\nI hope this helps, Professor!
